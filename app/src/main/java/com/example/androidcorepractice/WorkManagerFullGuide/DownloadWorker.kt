// Now we will create a so called worker: worker is basically a class that
// defines our work manager task.
// This would potentially also be something very large, to do
// you always not use work manager, You can use it for very big file
// to download in the background reliably.

// We want to use workManager to get up with coroutines
class DownloadWorker(
    // This two will contain more specific information about the worker
    private val context: Context,
    private val workerParams: WorkerParameters
) : CoroutineWorker(context, workerParams) {

    // ctrl+i
    // This is the function which will do the actual work
    // We can return Result which will come from workManagerAPi, and then
    // workManagerApi will use that result to determine, was the task successful
    // was the download successful, did something fail or should actually
    // retried later (that's also possible with work manager)

    // In this function we have to download the image using the API

    // - (06-10-2024)
    // WorkManager contains a behaviour of showing a easy notification
    // since in can. if we have a long running task it will
    // execute it in a foreground service, and when we want to show
    // notification then we need to create a notification channel
    // that is usually done in an application class
